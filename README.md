# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Warehouse Optimization

Scalable MARL system for optimizing order fulfillment, robot coordination, and inventory management in dynamic warehouses.

## Overview

Modern warehouses require intelligent coordination between multiple autonomous robots for:
- Order picking and batching optimization
- Collision-free navigation
- Dynamic inventory restocking
- Scalability to 50+ heterogeneous agents

## Tech Stack
- RLlib (Ray) for multi-agent training
- Gymnasium custom warehouse environment
- PyTorch for policy networks
- PPO and QMIX algorithms
- GCP Vertex AI for distributed training
- MLflow for experiment tracking

## Current Progress
- Custom Gymnasium warehouse environment (complete)
- Single-agent PPO baseline (complete) 
- Multi-agent RLlib configuration (in progress)
- GCP Vertex AI pipeline (planned)
